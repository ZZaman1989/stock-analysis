# STOCK ANALYSIS WITH VBA 

## OVERVIEW: VBA Stock Analysis Project

### Purpose
In this project and analyisis, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

### Analysis and Challenges
Here's a quick look at the Kickstarting Analysis and Challenges of this Project, including the following tasks:

- Prepare our dataser `VBA_Challenge.vbs` file for the project.
- Create our resources folder in **GitHub** to hold the run-time pop-up messages that we’ll screenshot after running refactored analyses for 2017 and 2018.
- Create and convert our `XLSM` file from `*.vbs` dataset that you used in this module as `VBA_Challenge.xlsm`.
- Add the VBA_Challenge.vbs script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.
- Use the steps **Refactor VBA code and measure performance** to add code where indicated by the numbered comments in the starter code file.

> Use your knowledge of VBA and the starter code provided in this Project to refactor the VBA Script dataset so we loop through the data one time and collect all of the information.

#### Our Challenge Data Background
> Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

## SUMMARY: Our Statement:

### Deliverable with detail analysis:
**1. Detailed statement on advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code.**


**Disadvantages:**

* Requires more complexity and creativity
* Might take more storage space
* Might be harder to debug if it's too complex

**Advantages:**
* Code runs faster and more efficient
* Can extend the code to run more than the originally intended set of analysis
* Code is cleaner

**2. Detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script.**

**Disadvantages:**
* Requires more data structures like arrays
* Had to hold more data in storage for the time the code was running 
* A bit more complex than original code

**Advantages:**
* Code ran a lot faster: 3-4 times
* We can now use it to analyze more than 12 stocks
* Code is cleaner
