# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
Analyzing data and creating macros for Steve to analyze stocks.

### Purpose
Refactor the VBA code to analyze the stock market dataset. Refactoring a code can help the macro be more efficient in taking fewer steps or improving the logicical steps in coding.

## Results
#### Refactored certain code such as creating a ticker Index

## Summary
-What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Adavantages of refactoring a code are: Better comprehensibility facilitates maintenance and the extendibility of the software, improved legibility improves the comprehensibility of the code for other programmers,Clean code with shorter, self-contained methods and classes is characterized by better testability.
Disadvantages of refactoring a code: Imprecise refactoring could introduce new bugs and errors into the code, there is no clear definition of neat code, an improved code is often difficult for the customer to recognize, since the functionality stays the same, i.e. the benefit is not self-evident.
-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
A clean and well-organized code is always easy to change, easy to understand, and easy to maintain. You can avoid facing difficulty later if you pay attention to the code refactoring process earlier.
